I'm having trouble implementing the search feature on my blog. I spent **all. day.** working on it and have literally nothing to show for it. Ho hum!

Well, not all day actually. With fresh eyes in the morning I refactored the layouts and partials a bit to make the theme more modularized. As I'm adding more pages, I realized this would help dry it up.

I also got all of the tags working properly: they are listed on a page with all of the relevant articles, and clickable by themselves to generate individual tag pages. I also added a tags display onto each post page, which wasn't on my original blog. Finally, I also made some design tweaks throughout the site to soften things up a bit...get rid of all the hard corners.

So all in all not a completely unproductive day!

### Up Next

I would love to get the search running. I have some leads to try tomorrow, and hopefully my brain will start working properly again by then! After that I will migrate all of the posts from the old Jekyll blog to the new one, and then I'll be ready to deploy! I think I will definitely make the deadline on this one, maybe even finish sooner.
