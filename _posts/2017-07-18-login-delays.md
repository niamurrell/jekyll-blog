Still trying to figure out how to implement the login feature in our [Metro app](https://github.com/CodingForProduct/metro_reward). Every time I think I've got everything I need set up, I learn there is another dependency package that I haven't installed, and then that one needs another package, etc. etc. Today it was `express-session` which I'm pretty sure also requires `connect-session-sequelize` but still figuring it out. I'll be glad when it all makes sense and I can write a good round-up for reference later. I did find this post which has provided a bit of context: [How do Express.js Sessions Work?](http://nodewebapps.com/2017/06/18/how-do-nodejs-sessions-work/). Now I just need to read it a few more times!

### Other Stuff

I came across [this course](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/) which teaches advanced HTML and CSS. I only skimmed it briefly (see above) but looks like I great way to get beyond the basics I always see in other tutorials.


### Up Next

It's all about the login at the minute. Bootcamp is on hold until this is done!
