Reading advice everywhere I'm constantly reading, "build your own projects," "BUILD YOUR OWN PROJECTS," "**BUILD. YOUR. OWN. PROJECTS!!!**" So today I started one. ðŸ˜„  I think I'd been experiencing paralysis in coming up with something to build because I tend to want everything I do to be ***epic*** but I realize I need to just get over that, otherwise I'll never build anything! And following along with coding tutorials doesn't really cut it:

### Value App Project

There are some things that I stress about buying because I'm not 100% sure I'll actually use them, or that I'll get as much value out of them as I want to. Examples: gym membership, any membership really, pricier clothing or accessories, etc. I always thought it would be helpful/motivational to keep track of when I use these things, so that I can see the per-use value go down every time. For example, if I know it can cost me $4 each time I use the gym going 10 times in a month vs. $40 if I go once, I'll be *way* more inclined to go! Is that weird?  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯  Anyway today I wanted to use this, so I decided to just build it.

I'm going to use Node and Express so that I can practice more, following the [Udemy course](https://niamurrell.github.io/daily/2017/08/06/bootcamp-wrapup/) and my [Coding For Product](https://niamurrell.github.io/search/#CodingForProduct) project. I'm also going to use MongoDB because I'm more comfortable with it, and haven't solidly learned how to reference between tables using SQL. Also I know I can deploy this for free on Heroku with mLab, not sure of the SQL options there yet.

Today I mapped out the page structure and general app behavior so that I know what I need to build:

I am pretty sure I know how to build most of the functionality of this app, but there are some new things I'll need to figure out/reacquaint myself with:
* Persistent login user session
* Data associations (references & sharing items across users)
* Processing updates on the server (not direct user edits)

I also want to try using Foundation (instead of Bootstrap) as it's one of those things a lot of people talk about that I'm not familiar with.

Should be a fun one! 

### CS50

The full court press didn't press...more on that this week.

### Portfolio Website

Still contemplating CSS Grid. A huge part of me just wants to use Bootstrap to get *something* up, and then try Grid later...but I also want to do it now!! More hours per day please.

### Up Next

I want to build my value app so I can use it asap--just the function now and I'll take my time on the UI since these other projects are more pressing.
