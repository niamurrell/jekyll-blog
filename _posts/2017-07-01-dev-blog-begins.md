# Welcome!

This is my blog to keep track of what I'm working on as I teach myself to code. 

### I will...

* Post (nearly) daily reviews to keep track of what I'm working on.
* Collect cool things I come across in the dev community for inspiration.
* Recap talks & events I go to for the key takeaways.
* Learn a lot from having this record!

### The Focus Will Be...

At the time I am starting this blog I am focusing on full-stack JavaScript programming. I also want to improve my design capabilities using CSS. I want to build a few apps to see how it goes, and then maybe start thinking about other areas/languages I might be interested in.
