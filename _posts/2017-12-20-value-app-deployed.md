Hooray! The [value app](https://niamurrell.github.io/search/index.html#ValueApp) is officially [deployed](https://valuemax.herokuapp.com/). It's a bit anti-climactic, as in the end I've deployed it on Heroku rather than AWS. I'll post separately all of the things I learned about AWS along the way, even though I won't be using it going forward. Long story short: testing and working on the deployment over the last ~10 days quadrupled my AWS bill. And while $4 isn't breaking the bank, it doesn't beat free!

I'm glad I went through the process anyway. I learned a LOT. Now I'm glad to be able to move on to the next thing though, this has taken up way too much time!

### Other Stuff

Major hiccup in the study plans today, so I've got to re-configure how I'll be learning and what I'll be working towards for the next few months.
