### Clean Code by Robert C. Martin

A few weeks ago I got this book delivered from the library. I'd heard it recommended from several people and when I learned I can get it from the library, I jumped on it. Fun fact: there are only two copies of this book in the whole LA Public Library Network! I'm glad they have it at all ðŸ˜‹

So I started reading it when I got it but wasn't sure of the best way to take/keep notes for future reference. Well today I found [someone](https://github.com/jbarroso/clean-code) who outlined the whole book! So I forked the repo and will be adding my own notes as I go [HERE](https://github.com/niamurrell/clean-code).

### Other Stuff

I watched a handful of CS50 seminars which were introductions to topics like Data Visualization, audio recognition, React, D3, Pandas, city planning, etc. They were given as inspiration for final project ideas. I'm uncertain whether I will finish the remaining assignments before the end of the year.

### Up Next

TBD.
