I guess it shouldn't really be a surprise that [CS50](https://niamurrell.github.io/search/#CS50) is getting harder with each passing week! This week's homework is building some .bmp-reading and -copying and -resizing programs in C, no longer depending on the `CS50.h` helper file. I finished the first two assignments after *hoooouuuurrrrssssss* of brick walls and now I'm working on the .jpeg recovery program, which searches through a formatted disk to recreate the "deleted" .jpg files. Every time I working on these I assume I'll put half the day towards them so I can spend the other time working on my other projects. Not so.

### Up Next

So now I just want to power through it so I can get it over with.

The good news is, next week has no homework assignment!!!!!
