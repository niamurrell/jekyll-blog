Things are coming along with my new site! Today I got the blog ported entirely. I'll still need to copy over most of the posts, but otherwise it's pretty much ready to go live and replace this Jekyll blog.

Now I'm working on the portfolio page, and trying to set up my projects in a "database" (YAML or JSON file) to render them easily to the page. I have the data linking properly but so far can't get the links to display, so I'll keep working on that next.

### Other Stuff

Short post today because it's Christmas! 


### Up Next

After I get the portfolio section looking decent, I'll be implementing a search engine to the site along with pages for each post tag. To think I would have done this all manually before! I'm looking forward to porting my [travel blog](https://niamurrell.com/travel.html) too at some point so that it will be easier to keep up to date.
