I've picked up my CS50 assignments to close out the course by the end of the year. That will be my primary focus for the next few weeks, and with just a few assignments to do it should definitely be feasible.

I started today by porting to Python some of the very first programs I wrote in C. I knew it would be less complicated but wow! The first program Mario went from 21 lines of code to 8. At first I started to replicate the nested for loops necessary in C, but quickly realized it's completely not necessary in Python. I like this ðŸ˜‹


### Up Next

Finish this assignment on Thursday--Christmas party tomorrow!
