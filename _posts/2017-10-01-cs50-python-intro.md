I picked up CS50 and watched the next few lectures. Great to feel like progress is happening again!...it helped that the last 2 lectures didn't come with any homework =)

### Intro To Python

The course introduced Python as we're now switching from C. I've had a very brief intro before but it was helpful to see side-by-side comparisons of how we've done things in C compared to how they would be done in Python. Next step is porting all of the earlier homework assignments we wrote in C to Python.
