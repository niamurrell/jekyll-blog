Woo! Feels good to be back at it. For the past month I've been traveling for work and between the events we were working on and all of the travel, I got pretty much no time to work on my courses or projects. Today I finally picked up my [value app](https://niamurrell.github.io/search/index.html#ValueApp) to get back in the swing of things. Feels awesome!

### Semantic UI

Since the site is working properly, I want to get it looking decent with the aim to deploy pretty soon. I've used Bootstrap on a few other projects and think it's ideal to have experience with other frameworks, so I'm learning [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) to style this app.

First impressions: I love semantic code! Adding styles and colors and layout, and more importantly reading that code, is so much more friendly and straightforward than how I've written other sites in the past. I noticed I've been a bit clearer with my class names and id tags too.

Today I mainly worked on the page layout & spacing for looking at each `thing`. It's still pretty boring just being a text site but spreading out the information helps a lot with readability.


### Up Next

I'd like to use this project to get familiar with using AWS to launch a web server and database, so that will be the next step after getting the design to a presentable state.

I've also got stacks of coursework I've been looking forward to jumping into!
