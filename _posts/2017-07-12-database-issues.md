Still really struggling with getting a database working. It feels like I've been through dozens of tutorials--both video and text--and I'm still in the same place I started in...nowhere!

For my group project we are trying to use PostgreSQL together with Sequelize and Passport. For my bootcamp I'm trying to get MongoDB running. In both cases, although I have installed each program, getting the respective servers up and running is proving impossible so far. We even tried doing a group coding session today (3 heads are better than 1!) and got stuck pretty early on. On the one hand I'm glad it's not just me, but I literally don't know what else to try and I want to be making some progress!

Anyway I found what seem to be some pretty good tutorials on both Postgres and MongoDB which will be great when I can finally get it working. I'll share the links and info then.

### Up Next

Hoping for a database breakthrough tomorrow!
