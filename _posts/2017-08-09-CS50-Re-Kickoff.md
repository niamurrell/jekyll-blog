After a couple days' delay & tv-binge procrastinating I have officially jumped back into [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). This is an Intro to Computer Science course from Harvard University which I'm taking online via EdX. I started the course in May, but took a little break because I was finding it difficult to switch back & forth between learning C and doing all the JavaScript projects I was doing at the time.

Turns out I forgot a lot! I wanted to jump straight back into the problem set (aka homework) I left off with, but I couldn't even remember how to compile and run my code (`make <programName>`, `./<programName>`), so back to basics. So I re-watched the lectures for weeks 2 & 3 (2 hours each!!) and read through all the homework exercises I did before to reacquaint myself with C.

For future reference it will be handy to have the character types and their placeholders noted:

Data Type | Reference | Placeholder |
|---------|:----------|:----------:|
boolean   |bool|  ?  |
character | char | %c | 
string | string | %s | 
16-bit integer | int | %i | 
64-bit integer | long long | %lli / %lld | 
decimal number | float | %f | 
longer decimal number | double | ? | 

There are more types than this in C (and I'm pretty sure the `string` type is specific to CS50) but these are the ones introduced so far. Maybe I'll add to this as we go along.

### Up Next

Now that I'm caught up I can jump into the Caesar's Cipher and other cryptography assignments I left off with.
