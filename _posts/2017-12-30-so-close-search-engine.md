BAHHH so close yet so far!! I am literally inches from the finish line for my search feature. Today I made huge progress: I got search results to display for multiple documents, then I got it to work correctly with an external JSON file. Now I'm working on applying that code to a more complex JSON file which includes all of the content from my site. Because the data is referenced *slightly* differently I have to change some of the functions to call that data differently. And that's what I'm stuck on. I'm so close though, I'll definitely get it done really soon.

### Chrome Dev Tools

Today I worked with the debugger in Chrome for the first time. **It is so awesome!!!** The main challenge that stumped me yesterday turned out to be an off-by-one issue, which I wouldn't have figured out without Chrome's debugger. I was also able to clearly see the differences between the Jekyll JSON output and what I'm working with for my site. This information make it ***so*** much clearer to move forward. Now I get what all the fuss is about!
